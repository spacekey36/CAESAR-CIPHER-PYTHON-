Caesar Cipher in Python

A simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** encryption technique using Python. This project showcases the fundamentals of classical encryption, including text shifting, encryption, and decryption.


What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions.

Example:
- Plaintext: `HELLO`
- Shift: `3`
- Ciphertext: `KHOOR`
